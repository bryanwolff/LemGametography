# LemGametography
This was created to help promote a twitch gamers gametography stream.

This was also my first ever attempt at creating a webpage with little direction from the client.  I wasn't familiar with JavaScript so I had to research 
how to make the buttons work for the picture slideshow and I am still looking over the code to see where I need more practice and understanding when it
comes to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
